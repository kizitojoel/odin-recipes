    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>Pineapples on pizza is man's best inventions since the Wrighty brothers came up with the airplane in '06. This seemingly unorthodox
        mashup of macon and pineapples yields a unique flavor that is undoubtedly one of the world's favourites
    </p>
    <p>The macon consists of fried strips of bacon, either rectangular or circular. It's good, easy to cook and rewarding</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>4 small naan breads</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup pineapple tidbits, well drained</li>
        <li>2 slices deli ham, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 slices cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 thin slice red onion, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
            <li>Spread pizza sauce on naan breads and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. 
                Top with pineapple tidbits, ham, bacon, and red onion. Place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese has melted, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
